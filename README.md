# Snake Game
This a snake game. The goal is to direct a snake using the up, down, left and right arrows to food withouth hitting the boundaries of the box. After the game is over the player is presented with a form that allows them to save their score. There is also a page that contains a leaderboard, containing the scores of other players in descending order.
